# Editorial parity fixtures

The published rebuild copies `data/inputs/editorial/{glossary,guide}.json`.
These snapshots are described inputs, not a recovery of the missing original
editorial sources. Their registered hashes and commit/blob provenance are in
`provenance.json` and `data/sources.yaml`; see `docs/reproducibility.md`.
The original `guide_raw.txt` is absent. `synthetic-guide.txt` is invented test
content solely for exercising the parser; it is not presented as that source.
The historical glossary source and the route catalogue are frozen separately.

Regenerate or verify the expectations with Python 3.12 from the repository root:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=pipeline tmp/venv-data/bin/python packages/ingest/test/fixtures/editorial/generate_oracle.py --check
```

Omit `--check` to regenerate. The script runs the Python builders and verifies
the registered snapshot hashes. The required test uses only these frozen inputs
and writes `EDITORIAL_PARITY_REPORT` when set. To compare the candidate to the
current checkout's release and route catalogue, run `pnpm editorial:compare-live`;
this is a separate local check, not a required CI gate.
