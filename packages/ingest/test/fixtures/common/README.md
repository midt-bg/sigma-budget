# Common-layer evidence

The Python oracle was captured at revision `851e90f`, build date `2026-11-08`, with Python 3.12 and the locked pipeline requirements. `generate_oracle.py` regenerates the JSON expectations using the Python implementations. It does not call the TypeScript code.

`asbp-tables.json` contains only the two Annex 3 tables and `docx_check` extracted from `data/originals/asbp/asbp_tables.json` in `release-build-inputs-2026-11-08-indirect-tax-sources.tar.gz`. The archive, original table and fixture hashes are recorded in `provenance.json`. To regenerate, verify the archive hash, extract that one member under `tmp/ts-common-inputs`, and run:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=pipeline tmp/venv-data/bin/python packages/ingest/test/fixtures/common/generate_oracle.py
```

`annex.json` is the Python tree and arithmetic diagnostics; `execution-numbers.json` is the Python adapter applied to the pinned release; `registries.json` is Python's parsed version of both repository registries. `source-map/` is a small synthetic input tree used by `cli.registry_inputs`, including shared, missing, skipped and pending inputs. `source-definitions.json`, `metadata.json` and `format.json` capture Python's shared definitions and helpers. The published source layering and domain builders remain later migration jobs.
