# Budget and programme fixtures

The frozen inputs consist of the programme extraction and law cache at
`e2954c9`, plus resolved cells, PDF headings and row labels from the independent
Python `program_budget_pdf` reader. `capture_pdf.py` reads all 46 pinned PDFs,
checks each against `data/originals.sha256`, and records their hashes and parsed
evidence. The archive used to restore them is identified by SHA-256 in
`provenance.json`. The PDF reader remains in Python.

`generate_oracle.py` invokes the unchanged Python normalization and budget
builders against these frozen inputs. It never reads live repository datasets or
originals. Verify byte-for-byte regeneration with Python 3.12:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=pipeline tmp/venv-data/bin/python packages/ingest/test/fixtures/programmes/generate_oracle.py --check
```

The required tests compare all 44 scoped files with the Python oracle, verify
input and oracle hashes, and exercise damaged inputs. There are no accepted
differences. The current published release can be compared separately:

```sh
pnpm --filter @sigma-budget/etl... build
pnpm exec budget-ts build --inputs packages/ingest/test/fixtures/programmes --out tmp/ts-migration/candidates/05 --scope ministries,ministries-programs,programs --build-date 2026-11-08
pnpm exec budget-ts parity --oracle data/release --candidate tmp/ts-migration/candidates/05/data --scope ministries,ministries-programs,programs --policy packages/ingest/test/fixtures/programmes/policy.json --report tmp/ts-migration/candidates/05/live-diff.json
```
